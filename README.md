# Explainabillity of ML algorithms in Hate Speech Detection
 This repository contains the code associated with the research seminar in “Ethical Aspects of Machine Learning Methods”. In this context, this NLP work presents an approach to determine the potential trade-off between the accuracy and explainability of hate speech detection algorithms such as SVMs, XGBoost and LSTMs based on pre-trained and adapated FastText embeddings.
